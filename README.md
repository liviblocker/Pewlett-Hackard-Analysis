# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine which employees are of retirement age and which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program for younger employees. In this analysis, we created a table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, a table that holds the number of those employees by department, and a table that holds all current employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
1. Employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 are all eligible for retirement. Looking at the unique_titles.csv we can see there are 
2.
3.
4.

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis

For this analysis, I was asked to create a summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. While assessing the ride-sharing data by city type, I looked specifically at the following in Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities:

  * Total Rides
  * Total Drivers
  * Total Fares
  * Average Fare per Ride
  * Average Fare per Driver

## Results:
### Ride-Sharing Summary

As you can see from the ride-sharing summary below there are significantly more rides, drivers, and overall fares in urban cities as compared to rural cities. Suburban cities, unsurprisingly, lie in the middle.

The average fare per ride and fare per driver is much more expensive in rural cities, which makes sense when considering the larger geographical area that drivers may need to travel as well as the lower demand.

This data is further expressed in the graph below which shows weekly fares by city type over a four-month period. As previously discussed, the urban ride-sharing market is much more profitable, with fares in urban cities totalling over $1500/week and fares in rural cities totalling less than $500/week.

  ## Summary
Based on the above analysis, I would recommend the following to address the disparities in urban, suburban, and rural cities.
1. Increase marketing for ride-sharing services in rural cities both for consumers and drivers. With more drivers there will be more capacity for the service to be used.
2. Offer gas and vehicle maintenance incentives to drivers in rural and suburban cities to give them the opportunity to drive more frequently at longer distances.
3. Finally, depending on how hard you want to lean into any kind the immoral corporation vibe, I'd recommend purchasing the city parking systems in rural cities and hike the prices to de-incentivize rural drivers from using their own personal vehicles. If parking is as impossible as it is in urban cities, people are sure to use your incredible service.
