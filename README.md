# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine which employees are of retirement age and which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program for younger employees. In this analysis, we created a table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, a table that holds the number of those employees by department, and a table that holds all current employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
1. Employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 are all eligible for retirement. Looking at the unique_titles.csv we can see there are 90398 employees eligible for retirement.

2. As you can see in the table below, the majority of those of retirement age are senior engineers (22770) and senior staff (22005).

3. The table also shows that of 90398 employees only 2 managers are eligible for retirement.

4. Employees eligible for the mentorship program have to have been born in 1965 - as you can see in the image below there are 1549 employees who would be eligible to shift to parttime and assume a mentorship role for younger employees.

## Summary
While the Unique Titles table shows 90398 employees, fewer than that are actually of retirement age because the list includes employees who have already left the company. In actuality 72474 employees are of retirement age. That number may feel daunting, but it's important to remember than not everyone will leave at the same time. As it stands, there are only 1549 mentor-eligible employees, which is only a small fraction of the overall number of retirement-eligible employees. I would recommend that Pewlett Hackard expand their  mentorship eligibility criteria to include more of the retirement-eligible employee population.

An expansion of the mentorship program will slow the retirement rate and offer more opportunities to recruit new employees and bolster the skills of existing employees. An expansion will slow the negative impact of a mass staffing exodus.
